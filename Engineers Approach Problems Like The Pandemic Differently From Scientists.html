<h2> Q: Do engineers approach problems like the pandemic differently from scientists? <h2/>
A: Engineers would be nowhere without science, and science would be nowhere without engineering — because engineers put into motion what science has discovered. National Medal of Science winner Theodore von Kármán said, “Scientists discover the world that exists; engineers create the world that never was.” They’re both important.
“Engineer” is a verb, which means that it’s action-oriented. It’s a key way we look at life. Engineers consider themselves problem solvers and also creators. We create products, processes, and systems that address economic and societal needs — like the ability to telework. Engineers are used to thinking in systems; a pandemic is a system, for example, and society is a system.
