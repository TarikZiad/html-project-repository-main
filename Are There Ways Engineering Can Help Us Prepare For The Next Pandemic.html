<h2> Q: In light of what we’ve learned so far, are there ways engineering can help us prepare for the next pandemic? <h2/>
A: The National Academy of Engineering annual meeting — which will take place Oct. 4-7 — will explore that question. We’ve got some outstanding speakers — David Walt, for example, who has served on the Academies’ infectious disease standing committee, will speak about lessons learned from this pandemic and how to apply them in the future. Pamela Cheng, who is senior vice president for global vaccine products at AstraZeneca, will speak about engineering’s role in the pandemic. (More information on the annual meeting)
