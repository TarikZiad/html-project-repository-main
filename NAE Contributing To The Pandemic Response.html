<h2> Q: How is the NAE contributing to the pandemic response? <h2/>
A: NAE members are serving as volunteers on National Academies committees that are doing studies related to the pandemic. They’ve examined subjects such as the effectiveness of fabric masks and how long the virus survives on surfaces.   
And in April, the NAE launched the COVID-19 Call for Engineering Action to incubate ideas for innovations that could help respond to the pandemic. Six hundred ideas came in, and we narrowed it down to 10 — one example is a self-cleaning mask — and teams pitched the ideas for investment and development. It was fabulous. I’ve heard from some of the participants that investors are interested in some of the ideas.
It’s an intergenerational effort. It started with a grassroots effort by two generations of engineers:  Grand Challenges Scholars, who are engineering students and recent graduates; and alumni of the NAE Frontiers of Engineering program, who are mid-career engineering professionals. Then some NAE members wanted to contribute, and they volunteered to serve on the expert review committee. Three generations of engineers are both learning from one another and working together to contribute in a time of national need.
The effectiveness of the nation’s and world’s responses to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recovery of both our economy and social well-being, will depend on the talent of scientists, engineers, and medical professionals.  Together, we will be successful.
